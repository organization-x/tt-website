	<Text>
		AI Camp was founded to revolutionize AI education around the world. In
		doing so, we have helped thousands of students prepare for university,
		industry, and oftentimes both. Our superpower is our unique teaching
		approach. It is a fusion of the world's best instructors (Stanford, CMU,
		etc.) and small class sizes that makes AI education intuitive,
		accessible, and successful. We don't teach from A to Z. Instead, our
		students learn by doing. They build impressive AI products, develop
		in-demand skills, and forge powerful connections with our mentors and
		advisors. AI camp is in the business of providing opportunity. We are
		unified by the maxim that we are only as great as the doors we open.

			AI Campâ€™s Team Tomorrow provides internships to motivated students
			and gives them the chance to work for external companies. We believe
			that the best way to learn is by doing, and so through this program,
			students can learn the real way that professionals learn, and gain
			real experience at a job while still attending school.

	<TextHeader>The mission that brought us here.</TextHeader>

	<Text>
		We experienced first-hand that our traditional education did not prepare
		us for the real world. Even though we had advanced degrees from top
		universities, the job market was tough us as we did not what jobs were
		available, what to learn, or who could help. In addition, college
		tuition has skyrocketed. Student debt in the U.S. has exceeded 1.6
		trillion dollars with the average student having $35,000 of debt by the
		time they graduate. To make matters worse 50% of graduating students are
		unable to find a job with their degree. This must change. We founded
		this camp to help students prepare for the real world. We hope that AI
		Camp can serve as early intervention in a student's life so that they
		are able to design the lives they want to have. Our students not only
		learn AI but how also how to pick a major, how to learn, network, and
		eventually become leaders in their chosen fields.
